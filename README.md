# Products Assignment Monitoring System - Project Overview

## Introduction
This project develops a monitoring system for managing product assignments across shopping center branches using a linked list. It facilitates tracking of employee responsibilities and product statuses, enhancing operational efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Linked List Implementation**: Utilizes a linked list to manage employee assignments and product statuses dynamically.
- **File I/O Operations**: Handles input and output operations, reading initial setups from a file and writing results to another.
- **Detailed Employee Management**: Provides functionalities such as adding, searching, deleting, and swapping employee entries within the system.

## Technical Requirements

- **Data Structure Manipulation**: Employs linked lists to efficiently manage and update data.
- **Comprehensive File Handling**: Reads from and writes to files to maintain system state and output results.
- **Algorithmic Implementation**: Incorporates specific algorithms for operations like deletion based on product status and employee information retrieval based on product emptiness.

## Objective

To demonstrate the application of data structures (linked lists) in solving real-world problems within a shopping center context. This project serves as a practical example of managing complex data with efficient algorithms and file operations.

## How to Use

- **Initialization**: Load system configurations and employee data from `intialInformation.txt`.
- **Operations**: Execute commands from `commands.txt` to manage and report on employee assignments and product statuses.

This README guides the setup and operation of the Products Assignment Monitoring System, making it suitable for both educational purposes and real-world applications.

Explore the code to understand the implementation of linked lists, file operations, and data management in a comprehensive system.
